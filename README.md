# MIT OpenCourseWare Scraper
Python Script to scrape through MIT OpenCourseWare website to download Course Materials.

----------------------------------------------

MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) is an initiative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to put all of the educational materials from its undergraduate â€“ and graduate-level courses online, freely and openly available to anyone, anywhere. MIT OpenCourseWare is a large-scale, web-based publication of MIT course materials. 

Recently while going through the [website](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) I had the idea of getting all the course materials and its details offline. So I checked how all the course details are being populated in the `Search by Topic` page, as it would be easy to scrap the search page rather than other ones. 

I am unable to write a brief description on how was this total script is running, but I made the script as simply as possible and you will be able to understand all the steps easily. 

You can start the script by running `python script.py`

Below is the output of the script :
